## Hola amiguitos

This was a dead-end attempt to add LiveDisplay components (like AntiFlicker, primarily) to an otherwise fairly stagnant device tree, even though the hardware supports it (as long as the kernel has the correct nodes defined). 
Going to be re-adding DeviceSettings instead of trying to move everything to lineage-sdk components, until such time as the LineageOS maintainers decide to spend the time focusing on older devices like ours again.
