## Hola amiguitos

This is a copy of 11.0-test-hybrid1.0 branch (I should really learn to make "tags", because that's effectively what I'm doing with these), which was used for the March 2021 release of crDroid v7.4.

It's based on the lineage-18.1 tree, with patchset 18 (30 Jan 2021, latest as of release) of unmerged A11 bringup commits by luk1337 from the LineageOS gerrit, plus relevant commits from the crDroid 10.0 device tree history, plus a couple modifications for the move to Illusion kernel (like removing panel modes from livedisplay since the LOS kernel node doesn't exist in the AOSiP kernel now).
